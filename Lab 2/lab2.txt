1. Build a body mass index calculator. The program must ask for a person’s height in 
centimeters and weight in kilograms, one after the other. It should then display the BMI 
in kg/m2
.
a. If the BMI is less that 18.5, the program also should respond with “You are 
underweight.”
b. If BMI falls in the range 18.5 and 24.9, the program should respond with “Your 
weight is normal.” 
c. Between 25 and 29.9, it should respond with “You are overweight.”
d. Between 30 and 39.9, the expected response should be “You are obese.”
e. For a BMI of 40 and above, the program’s response should be “You are morbidly 
obese.”
