PRACTICE
Consider the following base class, CPolygon.

class CPolygon {
protected:
 int width, height;
public:
 void set_values(int a , int b){
 width = a, height = b
 }
};

1. From this parent class, create two derived classes; CRectangle and CTriangle. Each should have 
an integer function area, which will be used to calculate the area of a rectangle and a triangle 
respectively.
2. Create one object each of the two derived classes.
3. Set the width and height values of the objects to 10 and 5 respectively.
4. Print out the values of the respective areas of the two objects.
